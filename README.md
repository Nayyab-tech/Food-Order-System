# Online Food Ordering Web Application

## Abstract

This project aims to develop an **Online Food Ordering Web Application** using modern web technologies. The system allows users to browse food items, add items to a cart, place orders, and manage their accounts through a web-based interface. The backend is developed using **Django**, while **MongoDB** is used as the database for storing users, food items, carts, and orders.

The application includes a simulated online payment system for **academic demonstration purposes only**. Since this is not a real commercial website, the payment system is not connected to any real bank or wallet account. Additionally, real-time order tracking is not implemented; instead, order status is displayed in predefined stages.

## 1. Introduction

An Online Food Ordering Web Application allows customers to order food through a website without visiting a restaurant physically. With the growth of internet usage, web-based food ordering systems have become popular due to convenience and efficiency. This project focuses on building a single-platform food ordering system that demonstrates **frontend and backend integration**, database handling using MongoDB, and core web application functionality suitable for academic learning.

### 1.1 Problem Statement

- Manual food ordering is time-consuming and prone to errors.  
- Customers have limited access to menu details in traditional systems.  
- Order management becomes difficult without a digital system.  
- There is a need for a web-based solution to simplify ordering and management.

### 1.2 Objectives

- Develop a functional food ordering web application.  
- Allow users to browse food items by categories.  
- Implement add-to-cart and order placement features.  
- Store data efficiently using MongoDB.  
- Demonstrate a dummy online payment workflow.  
- Provide order history and account management.

### 1.3 Aims

- Simplify the food ordering process.  
- Provide a user-friendly interface.  
- Demonstrate backend and database integration.  
- Create a real-world inspired academic project.

### 1.4 Motivation

- Increasing demand for online food ordering platforms.  
- Practical exposure to web development.  
- Learning Django and MongoDB integration.

### 1.5 Scope

**In Scope:**  

- Web-based food ordering system  
- User registration and login  
- Add-to-cart and order history  
- Simulated online payment  

**Out of Scope:**  

- Real bank or wallet payment integration  
- Real-time delivery tracking  
- GPS-based order tracking

### 1.6 Feasibility Study

#### 1.6.1 Evaluation of Existing System

Traditional food ordering systems rely on manual processes that are slow and inefficient. Existing online systems are often complex and require third-party services.

#### 1.6.2 Economic Feasibility

The project is cost-effective as it uses open-source technologies such as Django, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

#### 1.6.3 Technical Feasibility

The project is technically feasible using Django for backend logic and MongoDB as a NoSQL database.

#### 1.6.4 Operational Feasibility

The system is easy to use and does not require special training.

## 2. Literature Review

- Online food ordering systems improve convenience.  
- NoSQL databases provide flexible data storage.  
- Digital ordering reduces human errors.

## 3. System Design

**User Flow:**  
Registration/Login → Browse Food → Add to Cart → Dummy Payment → Order Confirmation


**Admin Flow:**  



Login → Dashboard → Manage Food Items → View Orders


**Database:**  

MongoDB collections for users, categories, food items, cart, and orders.

## 4. Expected Output

- Fully functional food ordering web application  
- Users can place and view orders  
- Simulated payment system  
- Admin food management
